  - [ ] Side-by-side or top-bottom game views
  - [ ] Separate score displays
  - [ ] Game over handling for both players
- [ ] **Multiplayer Features**:
  - [ ] Simultaneous gameplay
  - [ ] Independent piece generation
  - [ ] Separate hold systems
  - [ ] Winner determination logic

**Test Criteria**: Both players can play simultaneously, different controls work independently, game handles both players' game over states

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Game Engine**: Main game loop and state management
- **Board System**: Grid management and line detection
- **Piece System**: Tetrimino generation, movement, and rotation
- **Input Handler**: Keyboard controls and user input
- **Renderer**: Graphics and visual display
- **Audio System**: Sound effects and music
