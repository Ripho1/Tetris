- description: Meaningful documentation
  rules:
    - Every function must include a docstring explaining purpose, parameters, and return value.
    - Inline comments should explain *why* the logic is written that way, not just *what* it does.
    - Add short clarifications for Python features that may confuse beginners (e.g. class constructors, event loops).
    - If documentation or comments become too long in a single file, split related logic into smaller files/folders.
