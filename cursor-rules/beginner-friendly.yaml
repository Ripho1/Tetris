  rules:
    - Prefer readability over clever tricks or advanced abstractions.
    - Avoid unnecessary complexity â€” keep the code explicit and easy to follow.
    - When possible, use simple examples to illustrate core game logic (rotation, collision, input handling).
    - If examples or utilities accumulate, move them into a separate helpers/ or utils/ folder.
    - If any part grows too complex for a single file, split it into modules or folders with clear naming.
